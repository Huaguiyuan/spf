To produce the executable, do:

cd spf/
cd v7/
perl driver.pl 1
perl input.pl 1 > inputTest.inp
make
And this will create the executable
spf
under the directory v7.


When you have the executable file "spf" under v7/ you can do a quick run like this:
./spf ../TestSuite/inputs/input0.inp
for example.

<h3>8. POST PROCESSING</h3>
<h4>8.1 STATISTICS</h4>
To obtain averages from a certain observable that is logged in the Monte Carlo history file 
(.dat file, see documentation on OUTPUT FILES)
first look at the name of the observable in the .dat file, e.g.
<tt>Mag2=</tt>
and then use the <tt>average.pl</tt> script to obtain the average:
<tt><pre>
perl average.pl file.dat "Mag2=" | grep "##"
</pre></tt>
By redirecting the output a Monte Carlo history of the observable is obtained:
<pre><tt>
perl average.pl file.dat "Mag2=" > file.m2
</pre></tt>
that can be plotted with xmgrace.<br>
Notes:
<ul>
<li> For observables that have special characters, they have to be escaped, e.g., to obtain the number of
accepted spin changes(or phonon changes) in the Monte Carlo evolution the observable is named "Accepted[0]"
 (or "Accepted[1]" for phonons).
The characters "[" and "]" are special, so to get the history or average:
<tt><pre>
perl average.pl file.dat "Accepted\[0\]="
</pre></tt>
instead of simply "Accepted[0]".
</li>
<li> Only global observables are logged in the history file (.dat file). Local observables would consume too much
disk space and so only their averages are written at the end of the calculation to separate files. 
E.g. the "electronic energy" is
global (a single number) and so it is logged whereas the local charge density is local ( a vector) and so it is
not logged, but its average can be found in the .lcd file.</li>
<li> In the source code there aren't any variables to store averages of global observables since those averages are not
done inside the program but post-processing. On the other hand, local averages are done by the program and are
stored in the public structure <tt>aux</tt>. 
</ul>

<h4>8.2 FOURIER TRANSFORMS </h4>
<h5> Of Static Observables </h5>
Local static observables are written to specific files in a "linear order" format. The linear order is simply given by
<tt><pre>
i = x +y*L + z*L*L 
</pre></tt>
in 3D and similarly in less dimensions.
The script <tt>sq.pl</tt> performs a Fourier transform of a local observable store in "linear order". For example
the "classical spin correlation lattice" defined by
<tt><pre>
S_i = \sum_j S_j S_{j+i}
</pre></tt>
where "i" and "j" are site indices and "j+i" is the vectorial/lattice sum. The correlation lattice average is
stored in the classical spin correlation file (.cor file). Its fourier transform gives the classical spin
structure factor and can be calculated from the information in the .cor file using:
<pre><tt>
perl sq.pl file.cor D L 
</tt></pre>
where D and L are the dimension and length of the lattice respectively. This will produce two columns of numbers:
<tt><pre>
i S_i
</pre></tt>
where i is the momentum in "linear order", i.e. (in 3D):
<pre><tt>
i = mx + my *L + mz *L *L
</tt></pre> 
and similarly in less dimensions. Now kx, ky and kz corresponding to that index i are given by
kx=2pi mx/L, and similarly for the other components (if any). S_i is the structure factor corresponding to that
moment. There will be obviously L to the power of D indices i.
<h5> Of Dynamic Observables </h5>
Explain how to get A(k,omega) from A(r,omega).
